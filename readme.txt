Welcome to the Florida Man Game! 

The object of the game is to be the best fisher for the environment. Go through
the learning modules to figure out which fish are best and worst for the
environment, and pay attention to the rules page to learn how to be the best
fisherman. Then, choose the area of Florida you want to fish off of, and then
move your boat to the place you want to lay anchor and start fishing. Then,
earn as many points as possible by fishing for the right types of fish. 

To create this, we made different modes for each of the game pages, through
the educational information to the interactive map to the boat you can move
and finally to the fishing screen and final page. 

To run this effectively, make sure you have access to the 112 graphics package,
math and random packages, and have PIL and requests downloaded on the computer.
